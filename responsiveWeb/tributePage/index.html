        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Louis Wain's life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1860 </strong> - Born in Clerkenwell, London</li>
          <li><strong>1880</strong> - At the age of 20, he was left to support his mother and his five sisters after his father's death</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1881 </strong> - He moved out from home and rented a furnished room when he had his first drawing -Bullfinches on Laurel Bushes- published in the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illustrated_Sporting_and_Dramatic_News">Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1883</strong> - Wain married his sisters' governess, Emily Richardson, who was ten years his senior (which was considered scandalous at the time) and moved with her to Hampstead in north London. She soon began to suffer from breast cancer and died three years later. Prior to her death, Wain discovered the subject that would define his career. During her illness, Emily was comforted by their pet cat Peter, a stray black-and-white kitten whom they rescued when they heard him meowing in the rain one night
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1886</strong> - He specialized in drawing animals and country scenes, and worked for several journals including the Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News, where he stayed for four years, and The Illustrated London News,
          </li>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1886</strong> - Wain's first drawing of anthropomorphized cats, "A Kittens' Christmas Party", was published in the Christmas issue of the Illustrated London News. It depicted 150 cats, many of which resembled Peter, engaged in activities such as sending invitations, holding a ball, playing games, and making speeches. It spread across eleven panels.The cats remain on all fours, unclothed, and without the variety of human-like expression which would characterize Wain's later work. In subsequent years, his cats began to walk upright, smile broadly and use other exaggerated facial expressions, and wear sophisticated, contemporary clothing. He illustrated cats playing musical instruments, serving tea, playing cards, fishing, smoking, and enjoying nights at the opera. Such anthropomorphic portrayals of animals were popular in Victorian England and were often found in prints, on greeting cards and in satirical illustrations such as those of John Tenniel.
          </li>
          <li><strong>1907</strong> - He travelled to New York, where he drew some comic strips, such as Cats About Town and Grimalkin, for newspapers owned by the Hearst Corporation. His work was widely admired, although his critical attitude towards the city made him the subject of sniping in the press. He returned home with even less money, due to his imprudent investment in a new type of oil lamp.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1914</strong> - Wain created a number of ceramic pieces produced by Amphora Ceramics. Dubbed the "futurist cat", the pieces were of cats and dogs in angular shapes and with geometrical markings.[4] They are considered to be in the Cubist art style.
          </li>
          <li><strong>1924</strong> - The onset of Wain's schizophrenia may have been due to toxoplasmosis, a disease precipitated by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii, which is excreted by cats in their faeces. While the origins of the theory that toxoplasmosis can trigger schizophrenia can be traced back as early as the mid-20th century, by the early 21st century it remains unproven, with only tentative evidence that infection may affect people's behaviour, the theory remains the subject of ongoing research.</li>
          <li><strong>1924</strong> - when his sisters could no longer cope with his erratic, sometimes violent behaviour, Wain was committed to a pauper ward of Springfield Mental Hospital in Tooting</li>
          <li><strong>1930</strong> - At Napsbury Hospital near St Albans in Hertfordshire, north of London. Napsbury was relatively pleasant, with a garden and colony of cats, and he spent his final years there in peace. While he became more and more deluded, his erratic mood swings subsided, and he continued drawing for pleasure. His work from this period is marked by bright colours, flowers, and intricate and abstract patterns, though his primary subject of cats remained the same.</li>
          <li><strong>1939</strong> - Wain died at Napsbury Mental Health Hospital, St Albans, Hertfordshire, England. He is buried in his father's grave at St. Mary's Roman Catholic Cemetery, Kensal Green, London.</li>
